= BSV by Thought

== What is BSV by Thought ?
This work is, inspired by the beautiful works of William Strunk Jr. - "The Elements of Style", a manual for writing what I consider thoughtful BSV code.

The reader will come across most of this if they spend enough time writing BSV, or fully go through Rishiyur's work - "BSV by Example", or by self experience.

The primary reader of this work is intended to be my earlier self, when I was a complete beginner to BSV. Although, I still find myself to be pretty much a complete beginner.

Someone who is just getting started with writing their first module in BSV might find this useful, but others very little.
